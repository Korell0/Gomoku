# Five-in-a-row
.

## Story

In this project your job is to implement Five-in-a-row (also known as Gomoku) for two players.
You also can try writing some AI to play the game.

## What are you going to learn?

This game is centered around a board implemented as an array of rows (also separate arrays themselves).
You have to break down the game logic into parts and reassemble them into a solid game workflow.
And writing an AI will train your algorithmic thinking.

## Technical requirements

Please do not change `GameInterface.java` neither change any other method signatures
since that would break the automatic tests!

## Hints

- You don't have to come up with an AI strategy by yourself, you can search the internet
  for strategy descriptions. But, for your own good, please don't use external code,
  implement written instructions instead.
- Creating a really good AI for this game is way above the scope of this project.
  You should focus on the most basic aspects of it.
